						<a class="name" href="jonathanalcaraz.html"><h5>Jonathan Alcaraz</h5></a>
						<h6>Philippines | Deck cadet</h6>
						<p>Surfs up for Jonathan! Jonathan is an aspiring-marine-biologist-turned-seasoned-seafarer. Having been on more than 20 trips in the Philippines already, Jonathan was preparing to embark on his first international trip when the pandemic struck and locked him in Manila.
						At sea, Jonathan is a dedicated seafarer on deck. He courageously takes <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">the red-eye navigational watch to prevent any collisions with other boats. In his closest call at sea, Jonathan explains how important watchstanding is - even while in harbor. Yet sometimes, even a watchstander cannot win against the strong currents and big waves which bring ships twice as large as the one Jonathan sailed on only a hair away from collision.<br>

						Despite some nerve-wrecking experiences, Jonathan enjoys his time at sea. From catching fish to storytelling with crew members, Jonathan looks on the bright side. In fact, one of his favorite destinations became a favorite while waiting out a storm. During the calm before a storm in anchorage near the island of Samar, Jonathan and his crew found the four days of fishing and swimming to be a well-deserved and memorable break.<br>

						From his various adventures, Jonathan hopes seafarers take away one thing: a lot can go wrong, so don’t be cocky and absorb any advice the senior seafarers give like a sponge.

						<h5>Jyan Pantoja</h5>
						<h6>Philippines | 3rd Officer</h6>
						<p>Jyan is a 3rd Officer from the Philippines, but she is also the creator of a popular seafarer vlog, Jy's Journal. As the eldest in the family, Jyan had not considered a maritime profession until her family encouraged her to pursue seafaring.<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"> It took courage and persistence to complete training and to find a good company, but Jyan has not looked back since.<br>

						At sea, Jyan performs her favorite job: navigation. Although navigation can be really difficult, such as passing through a sea of fishing vessels in the China Sea, Jyan feels fulfilled when conquering close water situations. Instead, she suggests that the most difficult job is the job of the Chief Cook who has to please all of the crewmates!

						Jyan reads, watches movies, and films and edits YouTube videos in her free time at sea. Her vlogs about the maritime industry raise awareness about life at sea, especially about a woman’s life at sea. She advises fellow female seafarers to be strong, mentally and emotionally, focus on their goals, and share kindness.

						Now, stuck on land for months due to the pandemic, Jyan misses a life of travel and challenges. Although seafaring is not all rainbows, traveling around the world, and happiness on board, Jyan reminds all seafarers, those at sea and on land, to appreciate and enjoy life at sea.
						It is messy, with greasy coveralls, sleepless nights, and loneliness, but, to Jyan, it is wonderful and worth the struggles.

						In the future, Jyan hopes to obtain higher licensing, and hopefully return to Turkey for fantastic food and hospitality.
						At Seafair.io, we care for seafarers. Good luck Jyan!

						<h5>Demet Cayabyab</h5>
						<h6>Philippines | Cabin Steward</h6>
						<p>It is Demet’s dream to be a seafarer, and he gets to be one as a cabin steward. With a dozen years of experience on board, Demet has many stories and destinations to tell of. Demet hopes to continue building up his array of experiences in order to someday become <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">a supervisor and housekeeper on board.<br>

						In his experience, Demet’s favorite activity has been organizing fun events (like singing contests) for the crew in order to raise their morale. While Demet does not get to participate in the singing contests he organizes, we bet that he would always win.<br>

						Demet has also visited many ports across the globe: UK, France, New York City, Miami, Boston, New Orleans… The list goes on! However, he recognizes that the life of a seafarer is challenging, especially when faced with extended time away from family, loneliness, and bad weather like typhoons (Demet says it feels as if you were on a roller coaster). He appreciates his time with the crew and he looks forward to seeing his family at the conclusion of the trip.<br>

						Demet advises aspiring seafarers to pursue their passions because life is simply too short. Seafaring is a lot of excitement (and sometimes really good food). Speaking of food: Demet confirms that rice is a staple (even as a midnight snack), but he also surprised us by sharing that on a recent trip, his crew feasted on potatoes, meats, and wines for every month that they passed a test.<br>

						Cheers, Demet! Thanks for keeping so many crews strong and happy! We are excited to see where seafaring takes you next.

						At https://www.seafair.io, we take care of seafarers like Demet.

						<h5>Mao Bayotzin</h5>
						<h6>Philippines | 2nd Engineer</h6>
						<p>Happy Day of the Seafarer!
						Seafair celebrates you, and today we celebrate our first #FacesOfSeafair seafarer. Mao is a Second Engineer Officer but also an avid reader, gamer, and explorer from the Philippines. Although Mao initially aspired to study <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">chemical engineering in college, he enrolled in maritime courses for financial stability and learned to love his job. He shared his advice for incoming seafarers with us:

						Ask questions. The most important thing you will display onboard is your humbleness and willingness to learn from your peers.
						Be cooperative. Get along with your crew every day in order to have an enjoyable trip.
						Have courage. Seafaring is not a walk in the park. Seamen must be inspired by the profession. The paycheck will not be enough to take you to new horizons.

						Mao continues to educate new seafarers through an organization he founded called The Millennial Seafarers (@themillennialseaferers). He encourages his students to maximize their learnings on each trip and to continue using technical instructions they learned in school.

						Mao looks forward to new destinations and adventures (as well as good internet and Kawali). His favorite destination so far is the port of Rio de Janeiro. He says seeing the Christ the Redeemer statue was breathtaking and the beaches brought much-needed rest to the seafarers on the ship. Mao hopes to visit Venice sometime in the near future.

						From everyone at Seafair, we wish you the best of luck, Mao! We can’t wait to see what you do next. #SeafarersAreKeyWorkers

						<h5>Ryan Bernardo</h5>
						<h6>Philippines | OS</h6>
						<p>Ryan is a born seafarer. Currently an OS with a bachelors in marine transportation under his belt, he is working on gaining more seagoing experience before becoming an officer. It is his dream to be a seafarer, but Ryan admits that the process of becoming one is difficult. The hardest part for him was <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">attending strenuous exercises for his STCW certification and completing his apprenticeship.

As a seafarer now, Ryan and his partner enjoyed homemade hamburgers and festivities at home for Day of the Seafarer. He acknowledges that the life of a seafarer is difficult: from spotting pirate vessels on the horizon to sailing through high tides. However, he advises aspiring seafarers to never give up and to stay positive, as the journey is worth it.

On a recent trip to Scotland, Ryan was able to spot some famous castles. Next, he wants to travel to Australia and Japan. Eventually, Ryan would like to be captain.

We know that Ryan looks forward to playing cards and sharing stories with crewmates aboard his next ship.

Ryan -- welcome to the Seafair family! We can’t wait to help you achieve your goals.
