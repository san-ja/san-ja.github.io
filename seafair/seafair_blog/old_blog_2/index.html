						<h5>#FacesOfSeafair: Jonathan<h5>
						<p>Surfs up for Jonathan! Jonathan is an aspiring-marine-biologist-turned-seasoned-seafarer. Having been on more than 20 trips in the Philippines already, Jonathan was preparing to embark on his first international trip when the pandemic struck and locked him in Manila.
						At sea, Jonathan is a dedicated seafarer on deck. He courageously takes <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">the red-eye navigational watch to prevent any collisions with other boats. In his closest call at sea, Jonathan explains how important watchstanding is - even while in harbor. Yet sometimes, even a watchstander cannot win against the strong currents and big waves which bring ships twice as large as the one Jonathan sailed on only a hair away from collision.<br>

						Despite some nerve-wrecking experiences, Jonathan enjoys his time at sea. From catching fish to storytelling with crew members, Jonathan looks on the bright side. In fact, one of his favorite destinations became a favorite while waiting out a storm. During the calm before a storm in anchorage near the island of Samar, Jonathan and his crew found the four days of fishing and swimming to be a well-deserved and memorable break.<br>

						From his various adventures, Jonathan hopes seafarers take away one thing: a lot can go wrong, so donâ€™t be cocky and absorb any advice the senior seafarers give like a sponge.

						<h5>#FacesOfSeafair: Mao<h5>
						<p>Mao is a Second Engineer Officer but also an avid reader, gamer, and explorer from the Philippines. Although Mao initially aspired to study chemical engineering in college, he enrolled in maritime courses for financial stability and learned to love his job. He shared his advice for incoming seafarers <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">with us:<br>
						Ask questions. The most important thing you will display onboard is your humbleness and willingness to learn from your peers.<br>
						Be cooperative. Get along with your crew every day in order to have an enjoyable trip.<br>
						Have courage. Seafaring is not a walk in the park. Seamen must be inspired by the profession. The paycheck will not be enough to take you to new horizons.<br>
						Mao continues to educate new seafarers through an organization he founded called The Millennial Seafarers (@themillennialseaferers). He encourages his students to maximize their learnings on each trip and to continue using technical instructions they learned in school.<br>
						Mao looks forward to new destinations and adventures (as well as good internet and Kawali). His favorite destination so far is the port of Rio de Janeiro. He says seeing the Christ the Redeemer statue was breathtaking and the beaches brought much-needed rest to the seafarers on the ship. Mao hopes to visit Venice sometime in the near future.</span></p>

						<h5>#FacesOfSeafair: Ryan<h5>
						<p>Ryan is a born seafarer. Currently an OS with a bachelors in marine transportation under his belt, he is working on gaining more seagoing experience before becoming an officer. It is his dream to be a seafarer, but Ryan admits that the process of becoming one is difficult. The hardest part for him was <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">attending strenuous exercises for his STCW certification and completing his apprenticeship.<br>
						As a seafarer now, Ryan and his partner enjoyed homemade hamburgers and festivities at home for Day of the Seafarer. He acknowledges that the life of a seafarer is difficult: from spotting pirate vessels on the horizon to sailing through high tides. However, he advises aspiring seafarers to never give up and to stay positive, as the journey is worth it.<br>
						On a recent trip to Scotland, Ryan was able to spot some famous castles. Next, he wants to travel to Australia and Japan. Eventually, Ryan would like to be captain.<br>
						We know that Ryan looks forward to playing cards and sharing stories with crewmates aboard his next ship.</span></p>
